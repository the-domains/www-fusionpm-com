It is the key to advancing patient care, improving outcomes and adapting in a rapidly shifting marketplace. Getting to market fast with clinically meaningful and marketable products is the central challenge of medical device development.</p>,<p>Traditional constraints Whether you’re producing medical device prototypes, small lots for pilot commercialization or clinical trials, or fixtures to aid mass production, the typical process often requires tooling with lead times and costs that increase with design complexity. So, by necessity, the manufacturing process substantially influences design.</p>,<p>Orthotics and bionics are expensive, especially when tailored to an individual’s anatomy. The typical manufacturing process requires tooling with lead times and costs that prohibit customization, especially for small children who can outgrow their implements faster than they receive them.</p>,<p>The standard offerings are often uncomfortable or unattractive, reducing compliance and preventing patients from realizing the benefits of their use.</p>,<p>By eliminating traditional manufacturing steps that make customization costly, Stratasys 3D Printing solutions can create attractive, functional and highly-personalized bionics, prosthetics and orthotics<br>in far less time and at a fraction of the cost.</p>,<p><strong>AEROSPACE</strong></p>,<p>Aerospace engineers rely on patented Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) Technology for prototyping, tooling and part manufacturing. FDM works with high-performance thermoplastics, including ULTEM 9085, to build jigs, fixtures, check gauges and end-use aircraft parts. Designers in aerospace have long embraced FDM for concept modeling and prototyping.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>“The parts look great! Everything is functional and up and running and we are very happy with the first impressions"…</h1>,<p><em>“The parts look great! I’m impressed with the overall part tolerance that you were able to hit which means that everything is going together really well. There are a few tight spots that I’ve had to file, but those are problems from my CAD. I built up the first full assembly yesterday with your first shipment of parts and it’s definitely getting a lot of attention”... Automotive Customer</em></p>,<p><em>"We look forward to doing more business with fusion. The parts we received are great"... Aquatic Equipment Company</em></p>,<p><em>"We got all of our parts in and they look great!. Thank you for the speedy manuacturing and delivery. Will definitely be sending you some more jobs soon"... Medical Industrie</em></p>,<p><em>"Just wanted to let you know we got the parts and they are beyond great. Thank you for the great work in which you guys do, it is greatly appreciated. I look forward to the rest of the parts and I am sure my customer will be more than happy"... Injection Molding Company</em></p>,<p><em>"I received the parts today, they look great!... Tools Company</em></p>,<p><em>"We received the package today. The prototypes are perfect!. Thank you so much for your patience with me and your diligence"... Technology Industrie</em></p>,<p><em>"I just wanted to drop you to line to let you know that we received the shipment of stocks here this morning and all went together perfectly. Thank you again for getting them to us as quickly as you did"... Arms Company</em></p>,<p><em>"The quality of the plastic is fantastic, rigid enough to keep shape and tolerance when impated, but not too rigid as to encroach on being brittle"... International Corporation specialized in production concepts</em></p>,<p><em>"The pieces look great. I have realy enjoyed working with FUSION and they was benn very helpful in "tweaking" my prototype is great and the color is perfect. My only negative comment is the price, but your price is much better than everyone else (so that's a big positive). Overall, i am very satisfied and will recommend you to anyone in need of a prototype"... Independent Business Owner</em></p>]]></description>
