It is the key to advancing patient care, improving outcomes and adapting in a rapidly shifting marketplace. Getting to market fast with clinically meaningful and marketable products is the central challenge of medical device development.</p>,<p>Traditional constraints Whether you’re producing medical device prototypes, small lots for pilot commercialization or clinical trials, or fixtures to aid mass production, the typical process often requires tooling with lead times and costs that increase with design complexity. So, by necessity, the manufacturing process substantially influences design.</p>,<p>Orthotics and bionics are expensive, especially when tailored to an individual’s anatomy. The typical manufacturing process requires tooling with lead times and costs that prohibit customization, especially for small children who can outgrow their implements faster than they receive them.</p>,<p>The standard offerings are often uncomfortable or unattractive, reducing compliance and preventing patients from realizing the benefits of their use.</p>,<p>By eliminating traditional manufacturing steps that make customization costly, Stratasys 3D Printing solutions can create attractive, functional and highly-personalized bionics, prosthetics and orthotics<br>in far less time and at a fraction of the cost.</p>,<p><strong>AEROSPACE</strong></p>,<p>Aerospace engineers rely on patented Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) Technology for prototyping, tooling and part manufacturing. FDM works with high-performance thermoplastics, including ULTEM 9085, to build jigs, fixtures, check gauges and end-use aircraft parts. Designers in aerospace have long embraced FDM for concept modeling and prototyping.</p>]]></description>
