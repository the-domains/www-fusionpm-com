PolyJet Matrix(tm) Technology is a process developed by Objet Geometries. The technology, more commonly known as 3D printing, works by jetting photopolymer materials in an ultra-thin 0.0006" layer by layer onto a build tray until your CAD part is completed. Because each photopolymer layer is cured by ultraviolet light immediately after it is jetted, it produces highly-detailed prototypes and parts that can be handled and used immediately, without post-curing.  
\*ABS-like  
\*High Temperature  
\*Transparent  
\*Rigid Opaque  
\*Polypropylene-like  
\*Rubber-like  
\*Bio-compatible  
\*Dental  
Objet's PolyJet Connex(tm) technology offers the unique ability to print parts and assemblies made of multi-materials for your overmolding needs with different mechanical or physical properties (ie Rubber Material over ABS-like material). Up to 14 different materials that when combined in specific concentrations and structures you can have as many as 51 different digital materials with unique mechanical properties that can provide a closer look, feel and function of the desired end-product.  
Fusion PM's team of expert polyjet printing service providers will help place a high-resolution, fine-detailed model into the hands of your designers and engineers.

The process for 3D printing:  
Concept Models  
Fit-Check Models  
Sales and Marketing Models  
Whether you need to evaluate the concept of an end-product, fit-check a part and assembly or create a presentation model with fine detail.
