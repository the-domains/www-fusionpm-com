Whether you need to evaluate the concept of an end-product, fit-check a part and assembly or create a presentation model with fine detail. 3D Printing is one of the many options that can help you.

3D printing is a process in which material is joined or solidified under computer control to create a three-dimensional object, with material being added together. It's used in both Rapid Prototyping and Additive Manufacturing.

Objects can be of almost any shape or geometry and typically are produced using digital model data from a 3D model or another electronic data source such as an Additive Manufacturing File (usually in sequential layers).

3D Print Types:

* Polyjet / Objet Printing
* Selective Laser Sintering (SLS(r))
* Stereolithography (SLS(r))
* Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS(r))
