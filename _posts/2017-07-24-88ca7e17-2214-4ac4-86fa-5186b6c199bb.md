**HEALTHCARE**

A mandate to innovate In health care more than in any other industry, innovation is more than just a buzz word. It is the key to advancing patient care, improving outcomes and adapting in a rapidly shifting marketplace. Getting to market fast with clinically meaningful and marketable products is the central challenge of medical device development.

Traditional constraints Whether you're producing medical device prototypes, small lots for pilot commercialization or clinical trials, or fixtures to aid mass production, the typical process often requires tooling with lead times and costs that increase with design complexity. So, by necessity, the manufacturing process substantially influences design.

Orthotics and bionics are expensive, especially when tailored to an individual's anatomy. The typical manufacturing process requires tooling with lead times and costs that prohibit customization, especially for small children who can outgrow their implements faster than they receive them.

The standard offerings are often uncomfortable or unattractive, reducing compliance and preventing patients from realizing the benefits of their use.

By eliminating traditional manufacturing steps that make customization costly, Stratasys 3D Printing solutions can create attractive, functional and highly-personalized bionics, prosthetics and orthotics  
in far less time and at a fraction of the cost.

**AEROSPACE**

Aerospace engineers rely on patented Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) Technology for prototyping, tooling and part manufacturing. FDM works with high-performance thermoplastics, including ULTEM 9085, to build jigs, fixtures, check gauges and end-use aircraft parts. Designers in aerospace have long embraced FDM for concept modeling and prototyping.

**ARCHITECTURE**

Because 3D printing architectural models offers time savings in the design phase, its niche group of users is growing. Therefore, it's important to know the strengths and limitations of both PolyJet technology and FDM Technology for this distinct application.

3D printing architectural models provides the opportunity to reduce the number of steps, improving design time, while retaining fine details of the final architecture plan.

Computer simulations have been used in engineering and architecture for a long time. However, visualization of buildings was traditionally done using scale models made of wood or foam board. This let architects see how the building would stand in physical space and whether any problems could be rectified. Now, 3D printing combines the precision of computer simulations with the tangibility of scale models.

This application requires understanding the concept and process of architectural design, and notions of scale, proportion, space, form and structure.

**AUTOMOTIVE**

Every industry is impacted by additive manufacturing. Over the past 10 years, additive manufacturing (AM) technologies have radically changed our way to design, develop and manufacture new things. In the automotive industry, those technologies have made wonders to bring new shapes to life, allowing for lighter and more complex structures at the best possible cost. While it remains true that 3D printing is still mainly used for rapid prototyping when developing new models or in concept cars, the evolution of the different AM technologies has led a way where it is also used for final parts in various situation. New materials, innovative finishes, shorter lead time now allow for 3D printing to be integrated more closely in the manufacturing process and in the future maybe in the supply chain for spare parts.

The automotive market is one of the biggest in the world, and therefore one of the most competitive. In its latest report about the Additive Manufacturing and the Automotive Industry, Deloitte stated that "the four largest OEMs accounted for a third of the global industry revenue of over 2$ trillion in 2013". Staying competitive and ahead of its competitors on this market is essential. As for the many other industries we are covering, 3D printing can play a specific role as a strong factor of differentiation for manufacturers of the sectors for two reasons: it allows for faster product innovations and it is a key factor to transform the supply chain. Under this scope, changes in the Automotive Industry are particularly noticeable with these specific 3D printing applications:

Supercars, Formula 1 and Concept Cars with 3D Printed Parts

The 3D Printed Cars

3d Printed Prototypes for the Automotive Industry

3D printed Spare Parts (for production and after-sale)

Miniature Demonstration Models

**ENTERTAINMENT**

In a business where every product is custom and unprecedented, 3D printing offers quick, agile fabrication. Effects studios, filmmakers and game designers use it in some of their most demanding projects.

Hollywood special effects studio Legacy Effects uses 3D printing to make blockbuster movies. And remember the farm family in Chipotle's award-winning 3D animation "Back to the Start"? They were 3D printed. Bono even swung from a 3D printed custom microphone during U2's world tour.

**DENTAL**

3D printing takes the efficiencies of digital design to the production stage. By combining oral scanning, CAD/CAM design and 3D printing, dental labs can accurately and rapidly produce crowns, bridges, stone models and a range of orthodontic appliances.

With a 3D printer doing the hard work, dental labs eliminate the bottleneck of manual modeling and let the business grow. For those eager for the day when everything from scheduling to finished restoration can be achieved digitally and automatically, the future is here.

**SPORTING GOODS**

Sporting goods prototypes often require a combination of rigid and flexible materials. Think of a helmet's hard shell and padded interior, or a pair of ski goggles with tinted lenses and rubber overmolding. Only PolyJet technology can produce prototypes with multiple materials and colors in a single, automated build, so it's ideal for sporting goods designers with an eye for aesthetics.

FDM Technology works with production-grade thermoplastics to produce parts with high impact strength and great durability. It's perfect for components that need to withstand tough and repeated functional testing.

**TOYS**

To capture the look and feel of your future products, only PolyJet can deliver fine details, smooth surfaces, playful textures, varied materials and vivid colors in a single, automated build process. You can even 3D print smooth, detailed injection mold inserts, so you can prototype in your intended materials, or get a jump-start on production.
