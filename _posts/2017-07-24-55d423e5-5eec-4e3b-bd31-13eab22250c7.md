Rapid prototyping (RP) is known as a process for quickly fabricating a 3D model or assembly using computer-aided design (CAD) data and rapid technologies for growing parts. RP processes are used throughout the manufacturing industry to prove concepts, test form/fit and shorten product development times. Fusion PM's rapid prototyping capabilities will speed your new products to market with technologies that include:  
\*3D Polyjet/Objet Printing  
\*Selective Laser Sintering (SLS(r))  
\*Stereolithography (SLA(r))  
\*Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS(r))

At Fusion PM, rapid prototyping experts work diligently to determine the best RP process for the intended product. Only after a thorough evaluation of CAD geometry and a review of the physical properties and mechanical requirements of the intended part, can a determination for the best rapid prototyping solution for your project be made. That's why when you call Fusion PM, you'll speak with a "real" project manager who will work quickly to understand your project needs and then rapidly assist you!
