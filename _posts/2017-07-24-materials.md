* **SHEET METAL**

Quick Turn Prototypes in 1 to 5 days. Production Quantities Also Available.

Sheet metal a metalworking process used to form metal into thin flat pieces that can be cut and bent into a variety of different shapes ranging in thickness from eight down to 30 gauge. Applications for sheet metal include car bodies, airplane wings, electrical machinery, medical furniture, architectural structures and customized special projects.  
Some of the most common sheet metals include:  
\*Aluminum  
\*Brass  
\*Carbon Steel  
\*Decorative Metals: Gold, Silver and Platinum  
\*Nickel  
\*Stainless Steel  
\*Steel  
\*Tin  
\*Titanium (Ti)  
\*Zinc  
Sheet metal components and products are suited for a variety of finishes and textures, in addition to a large range of color options. For added durability, high-quality powder coatings can be applied to provide a visually appealing, chemical resistant and corrosion-resistant finish.

* **METAL LASER SINTERING**

Complex Metal Prototypes and Parts in a Matter of Days, Not Weeks

Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS(r)) is a powder-based additive manufacturing process the builds parts, directly from computer-aided design (CAD) data, in 20-40 microns. A cross-section is scanned, a thin powder layer is rolled over the previously cured layer as the bed is lowered layer-by-layer until the build is complete. The post processing of DMLS parts includes heat-treating, EDM support removal and surface finish treatments.  
The DMLS process is used for rapidly manufacturing components and production metal parts from commonly specified pure metal alloys including:  
Cobalt Chrome  
Inconel  
Stainless Steel 17-4  
Titanium (Ti)  
DMLS was originally developed by EOS GmbH and is sometimes referred to as Selective Laser Melting (SLM), a similar technology commercialized by SLM Solutions and Renishaw.

At Fusion PM, our DMLS network speeds the delivery of metal prototypes and parts from weeks to days and sometimes even just hours as opposed to more traditional manufacturing processes. Rapid prototyping via DMLS can dramatically decrease development time for new products, and DMLS offers additional savings by eliminating the need for costly tooling during production manufacturing of metal parts for critical industries such as aerospace, automotive, medical and defense. DMLS offers many advantages:  
\*Speed of delivery times  
\*Rigorous testing of prototypes  
\*Prototypes that are as functional as production components  
\*Cost effective assembly  
\*Flexibility of short production runs

* **STEREOLITHOGRAPY**Smooth Surfaces and Exceptionally Fine DetailStereolithography (SLA(r)) is an additive manufacturing technology. The process cures liquid photopolymer resin with an ultraviolet laser to build parts layer upon layer, each typically measuring two-thousandth to six-thousandth of an inch (0.002" -- 0.006").Stereolithography offers advantages in terms of speed and can deliver functional prototypes and concept models in as little as a couple hours or one to two days. The amount of time it takes to build a part depends upon the complexity of the computer-aided design (CAD) geometry and the vertical height, or Z height, of the part. Commonly specified Stereolithography resins include:\*Accura 25 Polypropylene-like\*Accura 55 ABS-like\*Accura 60 Tranparent, Clear\*Accura Xtreme High Strength\*Protogen 18420 ABS-like\*Somos NeXt High Impact\*Watershed XC11120 ClearDepending upon the project, parts are typically delivered in one of three finish options: standard, primed or painted. For "strip 'n ship" orders, parts are cleaned of excess resin with a chemical bath and cured in an ultraviolet oven. For more advanced applications, parts can be copper or nickel-plated to produce metal-like strength, water-proofing, electromagnetic shielding and enhanced part finish.**Materials List Pdf File**[SLA 25][0][SLA 55][1][SLA 60][2][SLA Bluestone][3][SLA Extreme][4]

* **SELECTIVE LASER SINTERING**Plastic Prototypes and Parts Direct from CADSelective Laser Sintering (SLS(r)) is an additive manufacturing technology developed by 3D Systems. The process uses a high power laser fuse small particles of plastic, metal, ceramic and glass powders directly from computer-aided design (CAD) data into a three dimensional shape. As each cross-section is scanned, the powder bed is lowered by one layer thickness, scanning and sintering one layer at a time until the build is complete. Part tolerances typically measure three-thousandth to five-thousandth of an inch (0.0003" -- 0.005").The SLS process is used for rapidly manufacturing components and assemblies from a wide range of powder polymers such as nylon (neat, glass-filled or carbon-filled) or polystyrene. Commonly specified laser sintering materials include:\*Duraform PA Nylon\*Duraform FR Flame Retardant\*Duraform Flex Elastomeric\*Duraform GF Glass Filled\*Duraform HST Fiber Reinforced\*Duraform EX Impact ResistantSLS technology is growing and being adopted in many industries for low volume Additive Manufacturing, including; aerospace, automotive, consumer products, dental, robotics and medical industries. At Fusion PM, the technology offers numerous advantages to our clients, quickly delivering plastic prototypes and parts via Digital Manufacturing in as little as one to two days.While SLS began as a way to build prototype parts by Dr. Carl Deckard in the mid 1980's, it has grown in popularity as a limited-run manufacturing option to deliver plastic end-use parts.The people at Fusion PM have years of experience working with SLS materials and processes -- let Fusion PM get to work for you!
