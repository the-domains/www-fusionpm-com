Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining is a traditional manufacturing process often referred to as "subtractive" due to its nature of cutting away unwanted
material from a solid block of raw stock or from pre-existing parts with a sharp tool to achieve a desired geometry. CNC machining encompasses milling, turning and grinding delivering high-accuracy with very tight tolerance.

The most common materials used for CNC machining:

* ABS
* Polycarbonate
* LDPE
* Delrin
* Glass-Filled Nylon
* Nylon
* Polypro
* Peek
* Aluminum
* Stainless Steel
* Titanium
* Zinc
