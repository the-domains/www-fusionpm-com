Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining is a traditional manufacturing process often referred to as "subtractive" due to its nature of cutting away unwanted material from a solid block of raw stock or from pre-existing parts with a sharp tool to achieve a desired geometry. CNC machining encompasses milling, turning and grinding and  
delivers high-accuracy with very tight tolerances, sharp detail and excellent surface finish. The most common materials used for CNC machining include:  
\*ABS  
\*Polycarbonate  
\*LDPE  
\*Delrin  
\*Glass-Filled Nylon  
\*Nylon  
\*Polypro  
\*Peek  
\*Aluminum  
\*Stainless Steel  
\*Titanium  
\*Zinc  
Fusion PM's experienced CNC machinists take great care in all machining projects and oversee the manufacturing of low and high quantities of metal and plastic parts. In instances where part geometries are too complex, shapes can be machined and then fabricated together to product one piece.
