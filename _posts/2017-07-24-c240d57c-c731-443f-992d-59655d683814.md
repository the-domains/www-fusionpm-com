Extrusion is a process used to create objects by pushing material through a die of the desired cross-section. It's used at Fusion Prototype Manufacturing to produce prototype of aluminum parts, its low die costs make extrusion the cost-effective solution for aluminum prototypes that require:

* Aluminum 6061 & 6063
* Dimensional tolerances to +/- 0.001"
* Wall thickness down to 0.15
* Precision extruded shapes

We offer a variety of surface finishes like:

* Anodizing: chrome finishes ranging from light bronze to jet black.
* Sandblasting: bead blast textures.
* Polishing: bright shinny finishes.
* Powder Coating: metallic and lacquered finishes.
* Electroplating: abrasion and wear resistance, corrosion protection with aesthetic qualities.

Fusion Prototype Manufacturing delivers full-service aluminum extrusion, fast lead-times, high-quality prototypes and production with_**personalized**_ customer service and some of the _**most competitive**_ pricing in the industry.
