Extrusion is a process used to create objects by pushing material through a die of the
desired cross-section. It's used at Fusion Prototype Manufacturing to produce prototype of aluminum parts, its low die costs make extrusion the cost-effective solution for aluminum prototypes that require:

* Aluminum 6061  & 6063
* Dimensional tolerances to +/- 0.001" 
* Wall thickness down to 0.15
* Precision extruded shapes
