Extrusion is a process used to create objects by pushing material through a die of the desired cross-section. It's used at Fusion PM to produce prototype and high-volume production quantities of aluminum parts. Fusion PM's low die costs make extrusion the cost-effective solution for aluminum prototype and production runs that require  
\*Aluminum 6061 & 6063  
\*Dimensional tolerances to +/- 0.001"-after post machining  
\*Wall thickness down to 0.15"  
\*Precision extruded shapes

\*Delivering complex shapes with tight tolerances is Fusion PM's specialty. We also offer a variety of \*treatments that provide excellent surface finish:  
\*Anodizing: chrome finishes ranging from light bronze to jet black  
\*Sandblasting: bead blast textures  
\*Polishing: bright shinny finishes  
\*Powder Coating: metallic and lacquered finishes  
\*Electroplating: abrasion and wear resistance, corrosion protection with aesthetic qualities

Fusion PM delivers full-service aluminum extrusion, fast lead-times, high-quality prototypes and production with superior customer service and some of the best pricing in the industry.
