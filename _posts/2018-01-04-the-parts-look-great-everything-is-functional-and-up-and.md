  “The parts look great! I’m impressed with the overall part tolerance that you
  were able to hit which means

  that everything is going together really well. There are a few tight spots
  that I’ve had to file, but those are

  problems from my CAD. I built up the first full assembly yesterday with your
  first shipment of parts and it’s

  definitely getting a lot of attention”... Automotive
